This mods adds option to play as machine empire for custom races available in mod United Sci-Fi Races. It adds 24 robotic/cyborg races to Machine section. The mod requires [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=814332008] United Sci-Fi races [/url] and SD DLC.

It is made as a patch since it alters ...common\species_classes00_species_classes.txt. Unfortenatly, this is the only way I easely found to make work mechanics of SD for custom races.

In case you think that it is more organic than robotic you can always select the same portrait from base Sci-Fi races sections. To create machine empire you must select portrait from section Machine.

Following races included: 
• Doctor Who: cybermen, daleks;
• Halo: huragok, Cortana, prometheans;
• Mass Effect: EDI, geths, reapers, collectors, remnants;
• Star Trek: borgs;
• Star Wars: robots;
• Warhammer 40,000: necrons;
• Other: terminators, cylons from Battlestar Galactica;
• Special Stellaris races: 2 versions of The Contingency and variations of robots.
*Fantasy: robotic 2 races 

Only default + extended robots are randomised while other sci-fi specific robots will not be randomly spawned /generated.
